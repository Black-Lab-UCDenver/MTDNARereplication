This figure shows the repreat element enrichment analysis seen in supplemental figure 6. To generate this figure, the DFAM database was downloaded and overlaps were generated using bedtools with random geneomic regions as we las known regions of homology. These files were then used as input forthe R script that generated panel A. The remining panel were geneated using the same scripts in figure 6, the difference being they took the human micro homology outputs as inputs.
