This code will generate the figures seen in figure 7 panels B, G and H-K. The code will run in R 3.6. Panel B requires Gviz. Panels G, H-k use the same source code as featured in figure 6, the difference being this figure features data from yeast. In the code listed in the sub directories, changing the input files to the yeast output from the GRIDSS varient caller will produce the circose plot seen in figure 7 G, and changing the inputs to the yeast micro homology output will generate figures H-K. 

The output for these scripts, when correctly coupled with the necessary inputs will generate the following panels:
