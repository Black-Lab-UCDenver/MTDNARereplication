This code will generate the figure seen in figure 1 panel D. The figure is generated by creating a dot plot. The input file for this analysis is provided in this directory, 1D.csv. The input files were generated from FISH count data for the number of 2 independent probes per individual cell. Count data were joined for green and red probe counts such that green is left of the decimal and red is right of the decimal, for example, if there are 3 green foci and 4 red foci the result would be 3.4 on the dot plot. If you do choose to run the R program in this directory, please change the working directory in the code to the location of the input files.

The output for this script is the generation of a dot plot as seen in Figure 1 D
