# Figure 6

This code will generate the figure seen in figure 6, panels A through E. This code utilizes the output of the gridss varient valler to make the circose plot featured in panel a and the output of the homology or the microhomology analysis to generate panels B though E. The code in each of the sub folders is annotated to where the durectories and file names need to be added for use on a local machine. All scripts will run in R 3.6.

The output for this script is the generation of a circos plot for panel A and a series of graphs for panels B through E.
