    • Environmental stress induces DNA rereplication and TSSG of Metallothionein locus
    • Transient amplifications transition to inherited amplifications with chronic stress
    • Metal induced rereplication and amplification are conserved from yeast to man
    • Transition to stable gene amplification requires HR but not selective pressure 

This repository contains the code to perform the bioinformatics analysis for the indicated study. The repository is organized in to folders that detail general data processing steps and specific figures. Instructions as to how to use the code are included in each folder as a readme file and as comments within each program.
